    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>The black box is most likely a drain sort of thing on the inside and it leads to a connected tubes that goes into the drain, and out to the exit.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>At first we thought that it was a sort of mix of tubes that went all in different spirals which is why it took a second for water to pour out. My approach was to connect a tube to the thing on the top, that pours water into the big bucket/drain and connect that to another bucket with a tube that leads to the exit so it can pour water out, explaining why some water poured out would be because some was poured out of the drain because it overflew, and why some was kept inside was because the bucket caught water that leaked out. But what my group's model function was supposed to be, is that we have 2 cups/buckets of water and it was supposed to drop water when enough was poured in, it would then drop into a bucket with a tube and it would pour out water, we eventually tested it and it sorta worked. We did 5 tests/trials. The 1st test we poured in 400 and 250 came out, 2nd test we poured in 250 and 86 came out, 3rd test we poured in 500, and 620 came out, 4th test we poured in 250 and 130 came out, 5th and last test we poured in 50 and 0 came out. After these various tests my original thought of what might’ve been inside has been changed and I've been more open minded about what might be what's inside, but still haven’t completely forgotten and said my original idea was wrong, but I now think it’s between mine or this.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning P1</h1>
    <p>Models are constructive/creative ideas that we have of an object, system, machine, etc, and with these ideas we create it, and when we create the idea, it becomes a model, like when making a model of a computer, it is your own idea of what a computer is and how its built. The good part of it is that it makes you more open to what might inside a computer and how it’s built (using my last example of a computer), a limitation can be of how much resources you have, because resources are always limited, so you might not have enough of this or that, not being able to fully complete your model.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning P2</h1>
    <p>Sure that might not be the correct answer, but nobody knows what’s actually inside, so it’s not whether we're right or wrong, it’s what we think is inside of the box, and what my team thinks is inside of the box, is our idea of what’s inside. We could be completely wrong or right, but what makes us think our idea most likely right, is because if we pour water into the forward/right cup it will pour into a bucket and tube and any water that pours outside of the tube will land in the bucket, and we think when we pour too much, and a lot of it starts missing and overflowing the bucket, that’s when it starts to leak.</p>
    <h1> Reasoning P3</h1>
    <p>If another model was actually right, the first thing we should do as a group is compare our data with theirs, because if the data is pretty similar then that should mean both of the models actually work, whether both of our models are different, they work the same and the outcome is the same, but then we should look at the efficiency, because our models might have the same outcome, but because they have the correct model their model might be the more efficient one, so we should look out for them and improve our idea/model to better fit the correct idea. If we do not see how similar the outcome of our models are, and observe their model and see what they did which makes ours less efficient and right, then we will think we have to completely make a new model and that our idea wasn’t correct, even though they are similar, just built differently. So it’ll give a false idea instead of looking at the better part of things.</p>
